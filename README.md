**Due to the worldwide lockdown**, we have been seeing a distinct rise in activity on the server, occasionally hitting the current slot limit. The People of the Server have decided to secretly raise a little donation package for Nyan to increase the server capacity for the duration of the lockdown.

## Scope:
We want to collect enough money to increase the slot limit to 34 and the server RAM to 6GB for a few months. This costs about 10€ ($11 US, $17 AU) per month. All funds will go to Nyan’s account regardless of how much we raise.

## Strategy:
Brainiac is providing an account where the money will be held until there is enough to give Nyan a sufficient surprise (think 40€, enough for 4 months). After the first package we can either donate directly or collect it for one-month packages until the project reaches its conclusion.

## Instructions:
Your contribution to the project would be a one-time donation of just 5-10€ through PayPal or credit card. Our host is called Nitrado and here’s how to navigate the website

### Step 1
To save some time, Brainiac has prepared an account for you to login to. Send me a /msg ingame or a PM on discord for the password. Go to [https://server.nitrado.net/usa/gameserver-mieten]. If the page displays in German, go to the top right corner to select your language of choice.

Log in using the username and password provided.

### Step 2
Once logged in, open the drop-down menu in the top right. Click on **Charge Account**. This is some sketchy translation on Nitrado's part and it actually is the button to pay into the account's balance.

### Step 3
You are now in the menu where you can select the donation amount and payment method. Nitrado supports PayPal, all common credit cards as well as select prepaid payment methods.

Once you've made your selection, the **Charge Now** button appears, which takes you to your selected payment processor. 

### You're done!
The updated balance now displays in the account. You have my word as one of the longest-active players of the server that every cent will go to Nyan and pay exclusively for our Minecraft server. Not that there is anything else I could do with Nitrado balance anyway.

**Thank you to everyone who contributes to the project! Stay healthy and happy building**
